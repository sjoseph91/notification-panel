## Overview

A simple, responsive notification panel that provides custom styling for read and undread posts.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

When using flexbox to space out elements, and you need one flex-item to justify itself to flex-end, you can use margin-left: auto to quickly get the result.
